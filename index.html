<h3>Elevator Pitch</h3>
<p>A Bachelor's degree is not enough to qualify for many early-career positions.<br>
But how can one get experience if they aren't hireable due to their lack of experience? <br><br>
College students are surrounded by other students who want an opportunity to use their skills.<br><br>
Let's imagine that a film student wants to make a short movie. There are English majors, theatre students, and other students who might enjoy working on it as well.<br>
…But students don't always seek out other students on their own.<br><br>
The solution? A service that allows college students who want to create a project to meet students who need opportunities to use their skills.<br>
</p>

<h3>Problem Statement</h3>
<p>College students need experience, but internships and entry-level jobs often require the same type of experience that the student is searching for.<br> Students are stuck with the catch-22 of finding out how to get experience in order to get experience.
</p><br>
<h3>Solution Statement</h3>
<p>UConnect is a web application that allows college students to reach out to each other and work on projects for experience that they can put on their resumes.<br><br>

A user acting as a ‘Project Launcher’ can make a post describing the project they wish to launch, along with the skills or fields of study they’ll need expertise in. <br><br>

‘Project Seekers’ can browse these posts to find projects they wish to join. They can reach out to launchers.<br><br>

All users can browse student profiles and check skills and reviews, as well as whether that user is open for project invites or not.<br><br>
